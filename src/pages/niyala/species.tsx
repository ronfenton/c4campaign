          Be aware that some while Niyala is a separate world with its own
          features; many perfect parallels exist between Niyala and Earth, where
          recreating simple things is not worthwhile and would only add
          confusion. There is no Narcissi, but there is narcissism; and foxes
          and tigers exist in biomes appropriate, rather than inventing new
          animals to memorise for player and GM both. Where it concerns
          language, it is best to assume these are translated terms from some
          other in-world name for ease of play – the creatures of Niyala do not
          speak English, but the humans reading this certainly do.

          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            The world of Niyala is filled with numerous different species, many
            with their own cultures and ways of life. The majority of civilised
            species originate from the smaller continent of Dranend, and the
            most common or knowable of these species are listed here.
          </p>
          <h2>Common Species of Niyala</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Huvarin are a dark-skinned species with few noteworthy
              physical characteristics, surviving through social interaction and
              cultural integration. They are regarded by many as weak but canny.
              Individualistic and adaptable, they are easily underestimated.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Selaphae are tall and pale, with closer ties to magic than
              most. Difficult to kill and long-lived, they’ve a long time to
              perfect skills and present their mastery over others. They are
              traditionalists by nature, regarded by many as experts in the
              arcane.
            </li>
            <li>
              Taki-Ori are small-statured beings of diverse features;
              experiencing mutations and alterations to their form to equip them
              for their life ahead. They are communal and harmonious,
              integrating themselves with spirits and nature alike.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Kashaskans are an intense species of four-armed reptilians,
              with powerful physiques and overpowering natures; tempered by an
              insatiable hunger. Natural combatants, their power-struggles are
              legendary among most.
            </li>
            <li>
              The stocky Morazham are masters of the slow and sure; a methodical
              species well suited the ardours of tasks many would strain under.
              They are patient and practical, and have a mental resilience that
              many consider unshakable.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Uncommon Species of Niyala</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Lyestra bear vulpine features and innate magic, often regarded of
              questionable sanity; their psyche and existence are driven by
              emotion and interaction. They are long lived and eccentric, seen
              by many as creatures of chaos or impulse.
            </li>
            <li>
              The various Beastfolk species of Niyala are as diverse as the
              magic their continental home, Agune, is known for. While each
              species is different; the Felid beastfolk resembling many great
              cats are most known, in their tribal and often contesting domains.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Bogvari are a species of highly variable creatures with
              simplistic, violent social structures. Often seen as a destructive
              force, their resources are gained through violence and numbers;
              with members ranging from small to titanic in scale.{" "}

            Huvarin lack any physical advantages of disadvantages, typically
            putting them at a loss compared to other species specialisations.
            However, their innate ability to detect danger and interact with
            other creatures has done well to keep them alive.
          </p>
          <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Huvarin share the majority of biomechanical characteristics with
            their Earth parallel, homo-sapiens. They are predominantly dark
            skinned, as most originate from jungle environments – however in
            later times some lighter tones emerge in those with strong family
            history in Triaca and other colder regions. They possess the typical
            array of five-digited hands and toes.
          </p>
          <h3>Mental Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Outmatched and preyed upon by other species, both intelligent and
            bestial – the Huvarin have developed excellent natural processes for
            interpreting and parsing information for threat and danger
            recognition. While a subconscious act, they are capable of quickly
            parsing clues in their environment, or in the behaviour of other
            creatures – helping them act or adjust their behaviour accordingly.
            These features have ensured that many Huvarin demonstrate higher
            interest in high-risk scenarios, innately comfortable in their 
            higher-than-average chances of coming out unscathed.
          </p>
          <h3>Magical Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Huvarin that manifest mana-blood can be identified by a faint
            bioluminescence to their blood, and are reasonably common with an
            incidence of roughly 1:500. Extracted Huvarin mana-blood maintains
            its luminescence for a short period, and became the phenomena that
            prompted some cultures to investigate the potential of blood magic
            and understanding of organic creatures’ attachment to mana.

          <ul>
            <li>Simple Name: Wildling</li>
            <li>Age Range: Maturity 13, Old-Age 50, Terminal 65+</li>
            <li>Height Range: 112cm - 130cm</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            Small and physically weak by nature, Taki-Ori naturally adapt and
            manifest a number of unique mutations to prepare them for their
            lives; combining with an empathic nature that helps them work
            together.
          </p>
          <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Taki-Ori are a highly versatile species. Taki-Ori grow quickly to
            their full height and build, but until puberty resemble typical
            humanoids in features, though with only four-digited hands and feet,
            and somewhat lankier builds with proportionally longer limbs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taki-Ori during puberty suffer mutations that radically alter them
            on a physiological level, often taking on bestial traits, though
            rare more esoteric mutations are possible. Occasionally these
            mutations follow loosely a response to the physical stresses
            undertaken by the body during childhood, but these mutations can
            also be random.
          </p>
          <h3>Mental Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Taki-ori present higher empathy than the majority of creatures, and
            experience positive emotional responses interacting with both beasts
            and machines; and naturally form strong bonds with their peers and
            those around them, also suffering strong sympathetic responses to
            suffering or treatment of others. Their highly variable physiology
            is paired with their cognitive ability to quickly make reflexive
            associations between actions and reactions, useful when using
            complex equipment or attempting to learn elaborate physical
            processes.
          </p>
          <h3>Magical Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Manablooded Taki-ori manifest during the process of their other
            mutations, with 1:750 members presenting traits indicative of
            magical ability; resulting in slightly altered variations of their
            normal mutations, such as scaled individuals bearing unusual scale
            patterns, strange colourations in horns, or other divergences from
            typical alterations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, some Taki-Ori present an innate ability to observe and
            interact with incorporeal creatures, typically wandering, unbound
            spirits.

            Elves are often lean figured and pale skinned, with hair in various striking
            colours ranging from bright reds to soft violets and ambers, and with bright eyes
            occasionally flecked with silver or gold. They are tall and bear
            some elongated features; and while not particularly strong, they are
            naturally healthy and capable of impressive survival.
          </p>
          <h3>Mental Characteristics</h3>
          <p>Elves have a long life that lends quickly towards traditionalism and habit-forming, with most elves being
slow learners but having accurate recall and cognition. They often struggle to learn new concepts, a
difficulty that often gets worse with age. Elves are driven towards a perception of power, often seeking
out magic or authority.</p>
          <h3>Magical Characteristics</h3>
          <p>Magical bloodlines in elves are quite common, manifesting in roughly 1:100 individuals. Elven magicians
draw the full spectrum of mages, with their strong cultural focus on magic allowing it one of the few
fields where innovation and continued learning is encouraged. Manablooded elves can often be detected
by further angled features, and a subtle dermal ridge around the cranium, knuckles, and collarbone.</p>

and three fingers, with no weak digits – granting them a trait known by many as the ‘dwarven grip’. They
are strong and hardy for their size, with skin tones ranging only in grays and pale browns. While their
eyes are small, they have large pupils and only a narrow, slitted iris. The vast majority of dwarves are
male, with a ratio of approximately 1:12.</p>

often favour function over form. They can be emotionally distant and blunt to most creatures and are
naturally drawn towards their own kin, leaving many dwarves pursuing dangerous or self-destructive
actions without thought where it is believed to be the best for their own kind. Dwarves are
psychologically driven most by a perception of unity and order, disliking surprises and favouring work.</p>

          <h2>Characteristics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple Name: Skans</li>
            <li>Age Range: Maturity 12, Old-Age 35, Terminal 40+</li>
            <li>Height Range: 216cm - 250cm</li>
            <li>Weight Range: 120kg - 182kg</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Bulky, four-armed, strong and bearing scales that can help protect
            from injury; Skans are often intimidating creatures, made worse by a
            driving desire for food and a weak sense of empathy.
          </p>
          <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Intimidating to most creatures, Kashaskans are four-armed bipeds
            covered with a thick hide of dermal scales over a dense musculature.
            They possess features often attributed to lizards and dragons, with
            thick muzzled maws and sharp teeth. Individual Kashaskan features
            often involve various colourations in scales and patterns,
            additional dermal deposits, frills, horns, or blunt claws.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notably, Kashaskans lack any typical humanoid marks of sexual
            dimorphism; females and males have similar builds, and due to
            reptillian sex, can even be difficult to identify nude. Traits do
            exist, however, and can be learned on observatoin - such as scale
            patterns and proportions, and positioning of dermal deposits, bones,
            and horns in addition to variations in vocal tones. Kashaskans breed
            as reptiles do, with clutches of eggs, and have very high breeding
            rates with low-expectancy of survival to adulthood.
          </p>
          <h3>Mental Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Kashaskans suffer from an almost insatiable desire for food, and a
            weakened sense of empathetic response to other creatures; lending to
            often callous, selfish or violent behaviour. While a Kashaskan’s
            sense of hunger never truly subsides, and instances of gluttony are
            common among those with the means to do so, Kashaskans eating less
            than an equivalent of 4-6 meals per day quickly begin to suffer
            various forms of psychosis stemming from perceived starvation.
          </p>
          <h3>Magical Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            While Kashaskans have a reasonable proportion of manablooded
            qualities, at roughly 1:500; very few reach maturity, as the
            manifestation of manablooded Kashaskans is both obvious and
            dangerous. During maturation, manablooded Kashaskan suffer severe
            mutation of their secondary pair of arms as they form into large,
            draconian wings over a period of a week. Throughout this experience
            the Kashaskan’s hunger is increased in magnitudes, as their body
            attempts to replenish energy from such drastic changes - such hunger
            and pain often results in bouts of destructive rage, violence, or
            occasionally the Kashaskan's own death.

            Naturally versed in magic, Lyestra are magical, vulpine-figured
            humanoids whom exchange their immense power, for a natural
            susceptibility to their own chaotic lifestyle. Despite an apparent
            immortality; few Kitsune seem to live long lives.
          </p>
          <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Lyestran bear features resembling Selaphae or Huva members at first,
            with skin tones ranging widely from the pale whites of Selaphae to
            the darker tones of the Huva; however these are punctuated with the
            addition of vulpine ears and occasionally multiple tails. Lyestra
            are light-weight and lack strength, but are keenly tuned to their
            environment.
          </p>
          <h3>Mental Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            The deeper psychological makeup of Lyestra is only poorly
            understood, even by them, and varies wildly by individual. All,
            however, manifest a clear heightened reaction to emotional impulse
            of all varieties - no matter their outward displays, Lyestra bear no
            emotion lightly. This is combined with an apparent desire to
            interact with others, lending Lyestra to regularly seek out social
            interactions - perhaps tied to their innate ability to perceive
            emotions in detail from others.

          </p>
          <h3>Magical Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            All Lyestra are manablooded by nature, and have a permanent
            connection to magic - one which, if severed even temporarily, can
            cause them great harm. Every Lyestran has some attachment to a
            particular affinity for magic as well, manifesting in natural,
            magical abilities that are intuitive and rely instead on the
            creature's own magical nature. This has led to the concept of
            Lyestran 'types' or 'subspecies' - but in truth, it is merely a
            matter of what form of innate magic the Lyestra manifests. Lyestran
            spellcasters are rare, however, as impulse and chaos lends poorly to
            continued study.
